# First Customer Onboarding Guide

## Who to Target First

### Ideal First Customer Profile

**Target**: Small immigration consultancy in Lagos or Nairobi
- **Size**: 1-3 people
- **Current State**: Managing cases in WhatsApp groups and Excel
- **Pain Point**: Enough clients to feel disorganization, but not so many they need enterprise features

**Where to Find Them**:
- LinkedIn (search: "immigration consultant Lagos", "visa consultant Nairobi")
- Nigerian Bar Association immigration groups
- Immigration Facebook groups
- Local business directories
- Referrals from existing contacts

### Why This Profile?

- Small enough to onboard personally
- Large enough to see value immediately
- Active enough to provide feedback
- Willing to try new tools (early adopters)

## Your Pitch to Them

### ❌ Don't Lead With Features

**Bad Pitch**:
> "We have AI checklists, document management, and client portals..."

**Why This Fails**: They don't care about features. They care about solving their problem.

### ✅ Lead With the Problem

**Good Pitch**:
> "How many active cases are you managing right now? How do you track which documents are missing for each one?"

**Let them describe the chaos:**
- "I have 15 cases and I can't remember which client needs what"
- "Documents get lost in WhatsApp"
- "I don't know which cases are close to deadline"
- "Clients keep asking me for updates"

### The "Wow Moment"

Once they've described the problem, show them:

1. **Case Dashboard**: "Here's how you'd see all your cases in one place"
2. **Document Checklist**: "This checklist auto-generates for a Nigeria→UK student visa"
3. **AI Generation**: Watch their reaction when they see:
   - NYSC certificate requirement (Nigeria-specific)
   - Nigerian bank statement requirement
   - Birth certificate apostille
   - All appearing automatically

**This is your wow moment.** The moment they see Nigeria-specific requirements appear automatically, they understand the value immediately.

## Onboarding a New Agency — Step-by-Step

**Important**: Walk them through this sequence personally for the first few customers. Do not just send them a link.

### Total Time: 35-40 minutes
**Format**: Video call (record it so they can refer back)

---

### Step 1 — Account Setup (10 minutes)

**Goal**: Get them signed up and see the dashboard

1. **Send them signup link**: `https://immigrationai.co.za/auth/signup`
2. **Have them sign up** with their email
3. **Walk through onboarding wizard**:
   - Organization name
   - Country
   - Phone number
   - Billing email
   - Team size
   - Primary use case
4. **Confirm trial is active**:
   - Show trial banner on dashboard
   - Show trial end date (14 days from now)
   - Explain what happens after trial
5. **Verify dashboard loads**:
   - Cases list (empty)
   - Stats cards (all zeros)
   - Navigation sidebar

**Checkpoint**: They can see the dashboard and understand the layout.

---

### Step 2 — Create Their First Real Case (15 minutes)

**Goal**: Create an actual active case they're working on (not a test case)

1. **Pick a real case**:
   - "Which case are you working on right now that's most urgent?"
   - Use an actual client name and details

2. **Create the case together**:
   - Click "New Case"
   - Fill in:
     - Case title (e.g., "John Doe - UK Student Visa")
     - Visa type (e.g., "UK Student Visa")
     - Origin country (e.g., "Nigeria")
     - Destination country (e.g., "United Kingdom")
     - Priority (e.g., "High")
     - Submission deadline
   - Click "Create Case"

3. **Show the reference number**:
   - Point out the format: `CASE-2024-001`
   - Explain this is how they'll reference the case
   - "You can use this in emails to clients"

4. **Add assigned professional**:
   - If they have team members, assign the case
   - If solo, assign to themselves

5. **Link the client**:
   - If client already exists, link them
   - If not, explain they'll invite them in Step 4

**Checkpoint**: They have a real case created and can see it in the list.

---

### Step 3 — Generate a Checklist (5 minutes)

**Goal**: Show the AI magic — this is your wow moment

1. **Navigate to Checklist tab** in the case
2. **Click "Create Checklist"**
3. **Fill in details**:
   - Name: "UK Student Visa Checklist"
   - Visa Type: "UK Student Visa" (pre-filled from case)
   - Origin Country: "Nigeria" (pre-filled)
   - Destination Country: "United Kingdom" (pre-filled)
4. **Click "Generate with AI"** or "Create Default Checklist"
5. **Watch their reaction** when they see:
   - ✅ Valid passport (identity, required)
   - ✅ CAS number from university (educational, required)
   - ✅ Bank statements - 28 consecutive days (financial, required)
   - ✅ **NYSC discharge or exemption certificate** (Nigeria-specific!)
   - ✅ **Statement of account from Nigerian bank last 6 months** (Nigeria-specific!)
   - ✅ Birth certificate with apostille (Africa-specific!)

**This is the moment they get it.** They see requirements they didn't even think of.

6. **Show checklist features**:
   - Mark items complete
   - Link documents to items
   - See completion percentage
   - Add notes

**Checkpoint**: They've seen the AI generate a relevant, Nigeria-specific checklist.

---

### Step 4 — Invite Their Client (5 minutes)

**Goal**: Show them the client portal — most consultancies have never given clients visibility

1. **Navigate to case overview**
2. **Click "Link Client" or "Invite Client"**
3. **Enter client details**:
   - First name, last name
   - Email address
   - Personal message (optional)
4. **Send invitation**
5. **Show them what the client sees**:
   - Switch to applicant view (or show screenshots)
   - Client portal dashboard
   - Their case with status
   - Document checklist
   - Messages tab
   - Documents they can upload

**Key Point**: "Your clients can now see their case status, upload documents directly, and message you — all without you having to chase them on WhatsApp."

**This alone feels transformative to them.**

**Checkpoint**: Client invitation sent, they understand what client sees.

---

### Step 5 — Invite a Team Member (5 minutes)

**Only if applicable** — if they have a colleague

1. **Navigate to Team page**
2. **Click "Invite Team Member"**
3. **Enter colleague's email**
4. **Select role**: "Professional"
5. **Send invitation**
6. **Show org admin view**:
   - "As org admin, you can see all cases across your team"
   - Show analytics (if they have access)
   - Show team performance table

**Checkpoint**: Team member invited, they understand team collaboration.

---

## Handling the Payment Conversation

### Don't Wait for the Email

**On Day 10 of trial**, send a personal WhatsApp or email:

> "Hi [Name],
> 
> How has the trial been going? I noticed you've created [X] cases and generated [X] checklists. 
> 
> Happy to answer any questions before your trial ends on [date]. 
> 
> You can upgrade at [link] — the Professional plan at R699/month is the most popular for consultancies your size.
> 
> Let me know if you'd like to hop on a quick call to discuss!"

**Why This Works**:
- Personal outreach (not automated)
- Shows you're paying attention (usage data)
- Warm conversation (not cold renewal notice)
- Gives them time to decide (4 days before expiry)

### Pricing Objection Handling

**Most Common Objection**: "R699 is a lot."

**Your Response**:
> "How much do you charge per visa application?"

**They'll say**: R3,000 - R8,000

**Your Response**:
> "One successful application pays for 4-11 months of the platform. And if better document management helps you process even one more application per month, it pays for itself many times over."

**Alternative Response** (if they're price-sensitive):
> "I understand. The Starter plan at R299/month gives you 10 cases per month — that might be a better fit to start. You can always upgrade later."

## What to Track for Your First 10 Customers

Keep a simple spreadsheet with these columns:

| Agency Name | Users | Cases (30d) | Features Used | Complaints/Requests | Converted? | Why Not? |
|-------------|-------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|------------|---------|
| ABC Immigration | 2 | 8 | Checklists, Docs | "Need WhatsApp" | Yes | - |
| XYZ Consultancy | 1 | 12 | All features | "Too expensive" | No | Price |

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Usage Metrics** (from analytics):
   - Cases created in first 30 days
   - Checklists generated
   - Documents uploaded
   - Messages sent
   - AI features used

2. **Feature Adoption**:
   - Which features do they use most?
   - Which features do they ignore?
   - What do they ask for?

3. **Conversion**:
   - Did they convert from trial to paid?
   - If yes, which plan?
   - If no, why not? (price, features, timing, etc.)

4. **Feedback Themes**:
   - What do they complain about?
   - What do they request?
   - What would make them recommend it?

### Talk to Each Customer Personally

**Schedule two calls in their first month**:

1. **Week 1**: "How's it going? Any questions?"
2. **Week 3**: "What's working? What's not? What would make this better?"

**Your first 10 customers will tell you more about your product than any amount of planning.**

## Common Questions & Answers

### "Can I import my existing cases?"

**Answer**: "Not yet, but you can create them quickly. The AI checklist generator makes it fast — just create the case and generate the checklist, then mark items as you collect documents."

**Future**: This is a good feature request. Add to roadmap.

### "What if I need more than 50 cases per month?"

**Answer**: "The Agency plan at R1499/month gives you unlimited cases. But let's see how you use it first — most consultancies find 50 cases is plenty."

### "Can my clients pay through the platform?"

**Answer**: "Not yet, but that's on our roadmap. For now, you can track payments manually in case notes."

### "What happens to my data if I cancel?"

**Answer**: "Your data stays for 30 days after cancellation. You can export everything before then. We'll send you a reminder."

### "Do you support [specific visa type]?"

**Answer**: "We support all major visa types. The AI checklist adapts to any combination. If you see something missing, let me know and we'll add it."

## Red Flags to Watch For

### They Won't Convert If:

1. **They don't create a real case in first week**
   - They're not engaged
   - Follow up: "I noticed you haven't created a case yet. Want to do it together?"

2. **They only use one feature**
   - They're not seeing full value
   - Show them other features: "Have you tried the AI checklist? It's our most popular feature."

3. **They complain about price before using it**
   - They're not seeing ROI
   - Show them usage: "You've created 8 cases — that's R87.50 per case. How much do you charge per application?"

4. **They ask for features that don't exist**
   - They have specific needs
   - Document the request, but don't promise: "That's a great idea. Let me add it to our roadmap."

## What to Build Next (After First Paying Customers)

Once you have 5 paying agencies, feedback will cluster around themes. Based on this market, expect these top requests:

### 1. Mobile App for Professionals
**Why**: They work on phones. A React Native wrapper or well-optimized PWA should come before any other major feature.

**Priority**: High

### 2. WhatsApp Integration
**Why**: This market runs on WhatsApp. Being able to send case updates and document requests via WhatsApp rather than email will dramatically improve client engagement rates.

**Priority**: High

### 3. Bulk Document Requests
**Why**: Professionals want to select 5 checklist items and send one message to the client requesting all of them at once rather than triggering individual emails.

**Priority**: Medium

### 4. Application Form Assistance
**Why**: The next logical AI feature after checklists. Pre-fill UK visa application forms, Canadian Express Entry profiles, or DS-160 forms from the case data you already have.

**Priority**: Medium

---

## Final Notes

**You have built a solid, well-architected platform. The foundation handles everything cleanly.**

**Go find your first customer.**

The first customer is the hardest. After that, each one gets easier because:
- You have case studies
- You have testimonials
- You have a proven onboarding process
- You understand the market better

**Start with one. Make them successful. Then find the next one.**

**Good luck! 🚀**
