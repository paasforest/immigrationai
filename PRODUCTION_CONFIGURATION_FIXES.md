# ✅ Production Configuration Fixes Complete

## 🎯 Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing Environment Variables
**Problem:** Production `.env` was missing critical JWT configuration.

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Added `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=immigrationai_refresh_secret_production_secure_key_2024`
- ✅ Added `JWT_EXPIRE=7d`
- ✅ Added `JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRE=30d`

### 2. ✅ Express Trust Proxy Missing
**Problem:** Rate limiting errors due to missing trust proxy configuration.

**Fixed:**
```typescript
// Added to backend/src/app.ts
app.set('trust proxy', 1);
```

This fixes the X-Forwarded-For header errors that occurred behind Nginx reverse proxy.

### 3. ✅ Missing Database Columns & Tables
**Problem:** Payment functionality failing due to missing database schema.

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Added `account_number VARCHAR(50)` to `users` table
- ✅ Created `pending_payments` table for payment tracking
- ✅ Created `payments` table for payment history
- ✅ Added all necessary foreign keys and indexes

Migration SQL executed successfully:
```sql
ALTER TABLE "users" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "account_number" VARCHAR(50);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "users_account_number_key" ON "users"("account_number");
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "pending_payments" (...);
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "payments" (...);
```

### 4. ✅ Missing Route Files
**Problem:** Backend failing to start due to missing route imports.

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Deployed `backend/src/routes/analytics.routes.ts`
- ✅ Deployed `backend/src/routes/team.routes.ts`
