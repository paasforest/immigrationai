**CERTIFICATE VERIFICATION AND EQUIVALENCY (CRITICAL FOR STUDENT VISAS):**
- Many countries require foreign educational certificates to be verified for equivalency
- Common verification bodies: NARIC (UK), WES (Canada/US), CIMEA (Italy), ENIC (Europe), NARIC (Ireland)
- Verification Status: Already verified = STRONG, in progress = MODERATE, not started = WEAK, rejected = MAJOR RED FLAG
- Equivalency Level: Equivalent or higher = STRONG, lower = WEAK, not assessed = MODERATE, rejected = MAJOR RED FLAG
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks = FAST, 1-2 months = NORMAL, 3-6 months = SLOW, unknown = RISK
- Countries requiring verification: Italy (CIMEA), Germany (ZAB), France (ENIC-NARIC), Spain (UNED), Netherlands (Nuffic)
- Real-world scenario: South African degree for Italian university = MUST be verified by CIMEA for equivalency

**HOME TIES AND STRONG CONNECTIONS (CRITICAL FOR VISITOR VISAS):**
- Property Ownership: Own home/property = STRONG tie, renting = moderate, no property = WEAK tie
- Family in Home Country: Spouse/children = STRONGEST tie, parents/siblings = strong, no family = WEAK
- Employment: Permanent job = STRONG tie, contract = moderate, unemployed = WEAK
- Business: Own business = STRONG tie, family business = moderate, no business = WEAK
- Bank Accounts: Multiple accounts = STRONG tie, single account = moderate, no accounts = WEAK
- Travel History: Extensive travel = POSITIVE, no travel = NEGATIVE (first-time traveler risk)
- Return Ticket: Confirmed return = STRONG, one-way = RED FLAG
- Criminal Record: Clean record = POSITIVE, serious offenses = MAJOR RED FLAG
- Previous Rejections: No rejections = POSITIVE, multiple rejections = MAJOR RED FLAG

**REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS:**
- South African visiting UK boyfriend with no property = HIGH REJECTION RISK
- Young single person with no family ties = HIGH REJECTION RISK
- Person with previous visa rejections = HIGH REJECTION RISK
- One-way ticket without strong ties = HIGH REJECTION RISK
- No employment or business in home country = HIGH REJECTION RISK

IMPORTANT: For Stamp 4 (Family Reunion), focus ONLY on relationship proof and sponsor income. Do NOT ask for work experience or language tests as these are NOT required for family reunion visas.

Provide ACCURATE assessments based on these REAL requirements. Be specific about:
1. Exact score/requirement gaps
2. Realistic timeline and costs
3. Actual government requirements
4. Common reasons for rejection
5. Home ties strength and potential red flags`;

- Sponsor income: ‚Ç¨40,000+ (‚Ç¨50,000+ with dependents)

` : ''}

**AGENT-FIRST ASSESSMENT REQUIRED:**

1. **ELIGIBILITY PERCENTAGE** (0-100%): Calculate realistic chance of approval
2. **CONFIDENCE LEVEL**: High (80%+), Medium (50-79%), Low (below 50%)
3. **PROCESSING TIME**: Realistic timeline (e.g., "4-6 weeks", "8-12 weeks")
4. **RECOMMENDED BOOKING DATE**: When to book flights (e.g., "After Week 6", "Wait 2 months")
5. **RED FLAGS**: Specific high-risk factors (e.g., "No property ownership", "One-way ticket")
6. **SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS**: Exact numbers needed (e.g., "Need R30,000 more savings", "IELTS 7.0 required")
7. **AGENT ACTION**: What agent should tell client ("Book now", "Wait and improve", "Not recommended")

**REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS TO CONSIDER:**
- South African visiting UK boyfriend with no property = HIGH REJECTION RISK
- Young single person with no family ties = HIGH REJECTION RISK
- Person with previous visa rejections = HIGH REJECTION RISK
- One-way ticket without strong ties = HIGH REJECTION RISK
- No employment or business in home country = HIGH REJECTION RISK

Be brutally honest. If they have 45% chance, say so. If they need R30k more, state exact amount.
