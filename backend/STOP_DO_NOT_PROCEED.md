# 🚨 STOP - DO NOT PROCEED!

## ⚠️ Answer "N" (No)

**Type:**
```
N
```

**Then press Enter**

## ❌ What's Wrong

Prisma is trying to:
- Drop `account_number` column (has 9 users)
- Drop `eligibility_checks` table (has 6 rows)
- Drop `marketing_sessions` table (has 4 rows)
- Drop `pending_payments` table (has 3 rows)

**This will DELETE your data!**

---

## ✅ What We Need to Do

1. **Answer "N" to cancel**
2. **Check the schema.prisma file on server**
3. **Make sure it includes ALL existing models**
4. **Then run migration safely**

**Type "N" and press Enter NOW!** 🚨
