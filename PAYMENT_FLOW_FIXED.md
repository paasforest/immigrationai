# ✅ PAYMENT VERIFICATION FLOW - FIXED

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before (WRONG):
- ❌ Account auto-activated on payment upload
- ❌ No admin verification needed
- ❌ Security risk

### After (CORRECT):
- ✅ Payment proof uploaded → Status: `pending`
- ✅ Admin reviews payment
- ✅ Admin approves → Account activated
- ✅ Admin rejects → User notified

---

## 📋 New Payment Flow

### 1. User Gets Payment Instructions
```
Account Number: PA24220
Bank: FNB
Account: 1234567890
Amount: R299.00
Reference: PA24220
```

### 2. User Makes Payment
- User transfers money to bank account
- User takes screenshot/proof

### 3. User Uploads Payment Proof
- User uploads screenshot
- **Status:** `pending` (NOT activated)
- **Message:** "Account will be activated within 24 hours"

### 4. Admin Verification (REQUIRED)
- Admin logs in at `/admin/payments`
- Sees all pending payments
- Reviews payment proof
- Checks bank account
- Approves or rejects

### 5. Account Activation
- **If Approved:** Account activated immediately
- **If Rejected:** User notified with reason

## 🔐 Admin Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
# SSH into Hetzner
ssh root@78.46.183.41

# Connect to database
psql postgresql://immigrationai:immigrationai123@localhost:5432/immigrationai -f /var/www/immigrationai/backend/prisma/migrations/add_admin_role/migration.sql
```

### Step 2: Create Admin User

**Option A: Using Script (Recommended)**
```bash
cd /var/www/immigrationai/backend
node src/scripts/create-admin-user.js admin@immigrationai.co.za YourSecurePassword123
```

**Option B: Manual SQL**
```sql
-- Hash your password first using bcrypt
-- Then insert:
INSERT INTO users (id, email, password_hash, full_name, role, subscription_plan, subscription_status, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'admin@immigrationai.co.za',
  '$2b$10$YOUR_BCRYPT_HASH_HERE',
  'Admin User',
  'admin',
  'enterprise',
  'active',
  NOW(),
  NOW()
);
```

### Step 3: Deploy Backend Changes

```bash
# On Hetzner server
cd /var/www/immigrationai/backend
git pull origin main
npm run build
pm2 restart immigration-backend
```
